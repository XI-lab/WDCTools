# wdctools

This repo contains a collection of short Spark programs used to process the output of [our modified version of WDCFramework](https://github.com/XI-lab/WDCFramework).

All tasks are short and simple enough to be quickly read and understood. Please take a look at the [Makefile](/Makefile) to see how to run each task.
